# Engine Partner API

Through Engine’s Partner API, companies can integrate Engine’s hotel inventory directly into their own products.
While Engine's platform also offers flights and rental cars, our API currently focuses exclusively on **hotel bookings**.

This API is ideal for businesses looking to:

* **Integrate Engine as a new hotel supplier** into their existing travel booking platform.
* **Build a brand-new travel product** that leverages Engine's extensive hotel inventory.

To begin integrating, please [review our documentation](https://engine-public.github.io/engine-partner-api).
Once you're ready, contact partnerships@engine.com to discuss a partnership agreement, gain access to your sandbox environment, and start the development process.

_Note: Engine reviews requests as they are submitted, and our team will work with you to align on development timelines._
